    /**
     This client program performs another striking visual effect: it morphs an image into its grescaled
    version. For example:
    % java Editor4 thor.ppm 50
    This action transforms the colored Thor image into a black and white Thor image.
    Implement the Editor4.java program, and test it. Sit back, watch, and enjoy.
    Implementation tips: The skeleton of the Editor4.java class is not given. You should write,
    document, and implement it yourself, from scratch. Itâ€™s quite similar to Editor3.
